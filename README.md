# Node graphql starter pack #

This repository serves as a boilerplate or a cheat sheet for creating a graphql interface with Node.js, TypeScript and Express ApolloServer.

## The project contains the following ##

* ApolloServer in express.js
* Graphql endpint at /graphql
* Express http endpint, to emphasise that a rest api could live side by side with graphql.
* Graphql schema read from file.
* TypeScript
* Dev server
* Eslint config
* Prettier
* TypeScript typedef generations from schema.


## The project does not include (yet)

* Tests
* Babel (hopefully never will)
